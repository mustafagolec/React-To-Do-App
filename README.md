# To Do Application (React)

This is my first React App. It's a basic to do app but I will be working on it while you are reading this.\
Before using, type `npm install` or `npm update` in the terminal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
